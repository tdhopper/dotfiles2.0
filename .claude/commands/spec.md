 Your task is to first help me build a spec for my new project in $ARGUMENTS.

Use the AskUserQuestion Tool to help build the spec in $ARGUMENTS by interviewing me and gathering requirements and details about the project implementation, UI & UX, tech stack, concerns, tradeoffs, etc.

Make sure questions are not obvious and probe deeper into the underlying needs and constraints.

Interview me continually and systematically until the spec is complete. Document all responses and insights to create a comprehensive and well-structured specification that serves as the foundation for the project.
