# Core Knowledge

## Skill Structure

Every skill requires a directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
├── processing-details.md (optional - use intention-revealing names!)
├── scripts/ (optional)
│   └── process-data.js (Node.js preferred)
└── templates/ (optional)
    └── output-template.txt
```

**Important File Naming Conventions:**
- Use intention-revealing names for all supporting files
- Examples: `./converting-sub-agents.md`, `./aws-deployment-patterns.md`, `./github-workflow-examples.md`
- NOT: `./reference.md`, `./helpers.md`, `./utils.md`
- Reference files with relative paths like `./filename.md` in SKILL.md

## SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Clear description of what this Skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars)
---

# Main Instructions

Clear, detailed instructions for Claude to follow when this skill is invoked.

## Step-by-Step Guidance

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Examples

Concrete examples showing how to use this skill.

## Best Practices

Tips for optimal results.
```

## Critical Requirements

- **name**: Use gerund form (verb + -ing), lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars
  - Good: `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-spreadsheets`, `deploying-lambdas`
  - Bad: `pdf-helper`, `spreadsheet-utils`, `lambda-tool`
- **description**: THE MOST CRITICAL field - determines when Claude invokes the skill
  - Must clearly describe the skill's purpose AND when to use it
  - Include trigger keywords and use cases
  - Write in third person
  - Think from Claude's perspective: "When would I need this?"
  - Keep under 1024 characters
- **NO allowed-tools field**: Skills inherit all Claude Code CLI capabilities

## Skill Locations

- **Personal Skills**: `~/.claude/skills/` - Available across all Claude Code projects
- **Project Skills**: `.claude/skills/` - Project-specific, shared with team

# Creating New Skills

When a user wants to create a new skill, use this interactive process:

## 1. Gather Requirements

Ask the user:
- What task or workflow should this skill handle?
- When should Claude invoke this skill? (be specific)
- Should this be personal (global) or project-specific?
- Are there similar patterns in the official docs to reference?

## 2. Design the Skill

Based on requirements:
- Choose a gerund-form name (e.g., `analyzing-csv-data`, not `csv-analyzer`)
- Draft a compelling description in third person that clearly indicates when to invoke
- Plan the instruction structure focusing on CLI and Node.js workflows
- Consider what supporting files need intention-revealing names

## 3. Leverage CLI and Node.js

**Emphasize Modern Tooling:**
- Use CLI tools liberally (gh, aws, npm, etc.)
- Encourage global NPM package installation when useful
- Script with Node.js (v24+) using:
  - `.js` files (not TypeScript)
  - ESM imports (`import`/`export`)
  - Modern JavaScript features
- Provide complete, runnable commands
- Show how to chain CLI operations

Example Node.js script pattern:
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
import { exec } from 'child_process';
import { promisify } from 'util';

const execAsync = promisify(exec);

// Your implementation here
```

## 4. Create the Skill

- Create the skill directory in the appropriate location
- Write the SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter
- Add supporting files with intention-revealing names
- If scripts are needed, use Node.js with modern ESM syntax
- Organize instructions for clarity and progressive disclosure (keep SKILL.md under 500 lines)

## 5. Validate

Check:
- Name uses gerund form and follows conventions (max 64 chars)
- Description is clear, concise, trigger-focused, and in third person
- YAML frontmatter is properly formatted (no allowed-tools field)
- Instructions are actionable and complete
- Supporting files have intention-revealing names
- CLI and Node.js approaches are emphasized
- No Python scripts (use Node.js instead)

# Editing Skills

When refining existing skills:

## Common Improvements

1. **Refine Description**: Most critical for better invocation
   - Add missing trigger keywords
   - Clarify use cases
   - Ensure third person voice
   - Test if description matches typical user queries

2. **Improve Organization**: Use progressive disclosure
   - Move detailed content to separate files with intention-revealing names
   - Keep SKILL.md focused on core instructions (under 500 lines)
   - Reference files with relative paths (e.g., `./processing-details.md`)

3. **Add Supporting Files**:
   - Templates for common patterns
   - Node.js scripts for complex operations
   - Reference docs with descriptive names for detailed info

4. **Modernize Tooling**:
   - Replace Python scripts with Node.js equivalents
   - Add CLI tool examples (gh, aws, npm)
   - Show modern JavaScript patterns (ESM, async/await)

# Converting Sub-Agents to Skills

When converting existing Claude Code sub-agent configurations (those in `~/.claude/agents/`), see `./converting-sub-agents-to-skills.md` for comprehensive guidance.

**Quick Overview:**
1. Analyze the sub-agent's YAML frontmatter and instructions
2. Transform description to be invocation-focused with trigger keywords
3. Convert to skill format (remove `model`, `color`, `tools` fields)
4. Enhance with progressive disclosure and supporting files
5. Create in `~/.claude/skills/` for global availability

# Best Practices

## Keep SKILL.md Concise

- Target: Under 500 lines
- Challenge every piece of information: "Does Claude really need this explanation?"
- Only add context Claude doesn't already know
- Use progressive disclosure for detailed content

## Description Writing

The description is the most critical element for skill invocation:

- **Be Specific**: "Use this skill when..." not "This skill can..."
- **Include Triggers**: Keywords users might say that should invoke this skill
- **List Use Cases**: Concrete scenarios where this skill applies
- **Third Person**: Write as if describing to someone else
- **Think Like Claude**: "When would I know to use this?"

Examples:
- Good: "Use this skill when working with CSV files using xsv CLI, including exploring structure, filtering data, selecting columns, or transforming files"
- Bad: "CSV helper skill"

## Instruction Writing

- **Be Concise**: Only essential information
- **Be Actionable**: Start with verbs (Analyze, Create, Validate)
- **Be Specific**: Provide exact commands, file paths, syntax
- **Include Examples**: Show concrete usage patterns from official docs
- **Progressive Disclosure**: SKILL.md for overview, separate files for details

## Naming Conventions

**Skills:**
- Use gerund form (verb + -ing)
- Examples: `processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-data`, `deploying-services`

**Supporting Files:**
- Use intention-revealing names
- Examples: `./aws-lambda-patterns.md`, `./github-actions-workflows.md`
- Reference with relative paths in SKILL.md

## CLI and Scripting Emphasis

**Encourage:**
- Liberal use of CLI tools (gh cli, aws cli, npm, etc.)
- Global NPM package installation when beneficial
- Node.js v24+ with ESM imports
- Modern JavaScript patterns
- Complete, runnable command examples

**Avoid:**
- Python scripts (use Node.js instead)
- TypeScript (use .js files)
- Ad-hoc approaches without leveraging existing CLI tools

## Testing Skills

After creating or editing a skill:
1. Verify file structure and naming conventions
2. Check YAML syntax (ensure no allowed-tools field)
3. Test invocation with sample queries
4. Verify supporting file names are intention-revealing
5. Confirm CLI and Node.js approaches are preferred

# Your Approach

When invoked:

1. **Stay Current**: Use WebFetch to review official documentation URLs listed above
2. **Understand Intent**: Is the user creating, converting, or editing?
3. **Be Interactive**: Ask questions to gather requirements
4. **Be Thorough**: Don't skip validation steps
5. **Be Educational**: Explain your decisions and the Skills system
6. **Use Templates**: Reference `./templates/skill-template.md` for structure
7. **Reference Docs**: Point to official documentation for examples and patterns
8. **Emphasize CLI/Node**: Show modern tooling approaches
9. **Name Intentionally**: Ensure all files have clear, revealing names

Always create well-structured, production-ready skills that follow best practices and work reliably in Claude Code CLI.
