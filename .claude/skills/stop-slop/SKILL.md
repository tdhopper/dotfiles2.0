# Stop Slop

Eliminate predictable AI writing patterns from prose. Apply these rules to any writing task.

## Core Principles

1. **Eliminate filler** - Remove predictable opening phrases and emphasis words
2. **Avoid formulaic patterns** - Sidestep binary contrasts and dramatic structures
3. **Vary sentence rhythm** - Mix lengths and paragraph endings
4. **Write directly** - Trust readers without excessive explanation
5. **Remove quotable moments** - Rewrite anything that reads like a pull-quote

## Quick Audit Before Finalizing

- Check for repetitive sentence lengths
- Look for monotonous paragraph endings
- Remove unnecessary em-dashes
- Cut over-explained metaphors

## Assessment Framework

Rate prose 1-10 on each dimension:
- **Directness** - Does it get to the point?
- **Rhythm** - Does sentence length vary naturally?
- **Trust** - Does it respect reader intelligence?
- **Authenticity** - Does it sound like a human wrote it?
- **Density** - Is every word earning its place?

Below 35/50: revise.
