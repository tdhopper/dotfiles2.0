# Addressing PR Comments

Fetch PR review comments, categorize them as obvious fixes vs. non-obvious, auto-fix the obvious ones (with confirmation), and iterate with the user on the rest.

## Usage

```
/addressing-pr-comments [PR_NUMBER]
```

If no PR number is provided, detect from the current branch or ask.

## Instructions

### 1. Determine PR Number

Try in order:
1. Use the argument if provided
2. Detect from current branch: `gh pr view --json number -q .number`
3. Ask the user with `AskUserQuestion`

### 2. Fetch All Review Comments

Run these commands to gather the full picture:

```bash
# PR-level review comments (inline code comments)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{PR}/comments --paginate

# Review summaries (APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED, etc.)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{PR}/reviews --paginate

# Issue-level comments (general discussion)
gh pr view {PR} --comments --json comments
```

Determine `{owner}/{repo}` from:
```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
```

### 3. Filter to Actionable Comments

Exclude:
- Comments from the PR author (they're self-notes, not review feedback)
- Bot comments (CI, linters, etc.)
- Already-resolved comment threads (where `gh api` shows resolved status)
- Pure acknowledgments ("LGTM", "looks good", thumbs up reactions)

### 4. Categorize Each Comment

Classify each actionable comment using `./comment-classification-guide.md` as reference:

**Obvious fix** — Can be addressed mechanically with no ambiguity:
- Rename variable/function
- Fix typo in code or comment
- Add/remove import
- Style/formatting change
- Add missing type annotation
- Simple null check or error message tweak

**Non-obvious** — Requires judgment, design decisions, or discussion:
- Architectural changes
- "Have you considered..." questions
- Alternative approach suggestions
- Performance/correctness concerns
- Anything where multiple valid responses exist

### 5. Present Obvious Fixes for Confirmation

Show the user a numbered list of all obvious fixes:

```
I found N obvious fixes from reviews:

1. [reviewer] file.py:42 — Rename `foo` to `bar`
2. [reviewer] file.py:88 — Remove unused import
3. [reviewer] utils.py:15 — Fix typo: "recieve" → "receive"
...

Shall I apply all of these?
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` with options:
- "Apply all" (Recommended)
- "Let me pick which ones"
- "Skip obvious fixes"

After confirmation, make the changes and commit them. Group into atomic commits by file or logical unit. Do NOT add Claude as co-author in commit messages.

### 6. Handle Non-Obvious Comments

For each non-obvious comment, use `AskUserQuestion` to present:
- The reviewer's name and the full comment text
- The relevant code context (file + line)
- 2-4 concrete options for how to respond, such as:
  - Make a specific code change (describe what)
  - Draft a reply explaining current approach
  - Open a follow-up task/issue
  - Dismiss (not actionable)

Execute whatever the user chooses. If they choose a code change, make it and commit. If they want a reply drafted, prepare it but do NOT post it (see Step 7).

### 7. Reply to Comments (ONLY When Explicitly Asked)

**Default behavior: NEVER reply to or post comments on the PR.**

Only post replies if the user explicitly says something like "reply to the comments" or "post responses."

When posting replies:
- Always prefix with: `*[This reply was drafted by Claude and posted on behalf of @{username}]*`
- Get the GitHub username from: `gh api user -q .login`
- Post using: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{PR}/comments/{comment_id}/replies -f body="..."`
- For review-level replies: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{PR}/reviews/{review_id}/comments -f body="..."`

### 8. Summary

After all comments are addressed, provide a summary:

```
Done! Here's what happened:
- N obvious fixes applied (M commits)
- N non-obvious comments addressed
- N comments skipped/deferred
- N replies posted (if any)
```

## Constraints

- Never auto-reply to comments without explicit user request
- Always attribute posted replies to Claude
- Group fixes into atomic commits (by file or logical unit)
- Do NOT add Claude as co-author in commits
- Follow the project's worktree workflow if CLAUDE.local.md specifies one
- Read files before editing — never guess at code context
