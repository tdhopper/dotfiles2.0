# Managing Dotfiles with Yadm

This skill helps manage dotfiles using [yadm](https://yadm.io/) (Yet Another Dotfiles Manager).

## Repository Info

- **Remote**: Your dotfiles git repository
- **Work tree**: `$HOME`
- **Yadm repo**: `~/.local/share/yadm/repo.git`

## Getting Current State

Always start by checking the current state:

```bash
yadm status          # Show modified/staged files
yadm ls-files        # List all tracked files
yadm diff            # Show unstaged changes
```

## Managed Files Reference

Run `yadm ls-files` to get the authoritative list. Common categories:

| Category | Files |
|----------|-------|
| **Shell** | `.config/fish/` (config.fish, aliases, env, functions, keybindings, plugins) |
| **Editor** | `.vimrc`, `Library/Application Support/Code/User/` (settings.json, keybindings.json) |
| **Terminal** | `.tmux.conf`, `.config/ghostty/config`, `.config/starship.toml` |
| **Git** | `.gitconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.gitmodules` |
| **Claude** | `.claude/skills/` (commit, creating-pull-requests, managing-dotfiles) |
| **Yadm** | `.config/yadm/` (bootstrap, hooks, README, install-hooks.sh) |
| **Other** | `.config/bat/config`, `.config/ruff/pyproject.toml`, `.duti`, `.hushlogin`, `Caddyfile` |

## Core Operations

### Pull from Remote

```bash
yadm pull
```

If merge conflicts occur:
1. Run `yadm status` to see conflicted files
2. Edit files to resolve conflicts (remove conflict markers)
3. Stage resolved files: `yadm add <file>`
4. Complete the merge: `yadm commit`

### Commit and Push Changes

```bash
yadm add <file>           # Stage specific file
yadm add -u               # Stage all modified tracked files
yadm commit -m "message"  # Commit with message
yadm push                 # Push to remote
```

**Commit conventions** (from commit skill):
- No AI/Claude attribution
- No Co-Authored-By headers

### Modify Configuration Files

When asked to modify a config (e.g., "update tmux to do X"):

1. Find the relevant file: `yadm ls-files | grep -i tmux`
2. Read and understand the current config
3. Make the requested changes
4. Stage, commit, and push:
   ```bash
   yadm add <modified-file>
   yadm commit -m "Update <config> to <what was changed>"
   yadm push
   ```

## Adding/Removing Files

### Add a new file to tracking

```bash
yadm add <new-file>
yadm commit -m "Add <file> to dotfiles"
yadm push
```

### Stop tracking a file (without deleting it)

```bash
yadm rm --cached <file>
yadm commit -m "Stop tracking <file>"
yadm push
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit is configured via `~/.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Hooks check for:
- Private keys and secrets
- Large files (>500KB)
- Trailing whitespace
- Merge conflicts

Run manually:
```bash
yadm enter pre-commit run --all-files
```

If a commit fails due to pre-commit fixes, stage the fixes and retry.

## Self-Management

This skill is itself tracked by yadm at `~/.claude/skills/managing-dotfiles/`.

When updating this skill:
1. Make changes to the skill files
2. Commit with yadm:
   ```bash
   yadm add ~/.claude/skills/managing-dotfiles/
   yadm commit -m "Update managing-dotfiles skill"
   yadm push
   ```

When files are added/removed from yadm tracking, update the "Managed Files Reference" section above if the categories change significantly.

## Useful Commands

See `yadm-command-reference.md` for a quick reference of common yadm commands.

## Bootstrap (New System Setup)

On a new system after cloning:
```bash
yadm bootstrap
```

This runs `~/.config/yadm/bootstrap` which installs Homebrew, uv, vim-plug, and other dependencies.
